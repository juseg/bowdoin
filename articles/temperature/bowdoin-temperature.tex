    \note{Preliminary abstract. The two first paragraphs will be shortened and
          reworked to better reflect the introduction.}

    The observed rapid retreat of ocean-terminating glaciers in southern
    Greenland in the last two decades has now propagated to the northwest.
    Hence, tidewater glaciers in this area, some of which have remain stable
    for decades, have started retreating rapidly through iceberg calving in
    recent years, thus allowing a monitoring and investigation of ice dynamical
    changes starting the early stages of retreat.

    Bowdoin Glacier, a small and relatively accessible calving glacier in
    Northwest Greenland, appeared to be very stable since its frontal position
    had been first documented by explorers in the late 19th century. However,
    following a two-fold increase of surface velocity in the early 2000s, the
    calving front of Bowdoin Glacier has experienced a rapid retreat of ca.
    2\,km between 2007 and 2013. Since 2013, the ice front is once again
    stable, yet the glacier surface continues to experience lowering at an
    alarming rate of ca. 6\,m/a.

    Here, we present a two-year record of englacial temperatures measured in
    the tidewater glacier tongue. The measured temperature profiles indicate
    that the glacier's ice is below pressure melting point except for its
    temperate base. More surprisingly, a temperature difference of up to 2
    degrees was measured between two boreholes that are located only 250 meter
    apart along a flowline. In addition, the warmer profile shows a slow
    warming trend of up to ca.~0.5\,$^\circ$C\,a$^{-1}$\todo{Refine.}. This
    patterns can be explained by latent heat release from meltwater freezing in
    transverse crevasses that reach to or near the glacier bed. These crevasses
    may be related to the tide-modulated extensional strain regime of the
    tidewater glacier tongue.

\section{Introduction}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    All around Greenland, ocean-terminating glaciers are accelerating and
    retreating faster than other parts of the ice sheet.

    As buoyance forces weaken and glaciers come close to floatation, basal
    friction diminishes and the only limiting factor left against flow is the 
    ice's internal viscosity.

    However, ice rheology depends very much on temperature. The ice softness
    varies by an order of magnitude between -15 degrees and the
    pressure-melting point. Numerical models show that such differences in
    rheology affect the shape and flow velocity of glaciers and ice sheets even
    in regions dominated by sliding and longitudinal stretching (check).

    But temperature was never measured on the terminal tongue of tidewater
    glaciers. This is because tidewater glacier tongues are fast-flowing,
    and often full of crevasses causing multiple practical and technical
    challenges to their instrumentation.

    Here, we present ice temperature measurements from Bowdoin Glacier, a
    tidewater glacier which is relatively little crevassed and located in the
    vicinity of the northernmost civilean airport of Greenland in Qaanaaq. The
    glacier has a beautiful medial moraine which allowed to walk down to its
    calving front and install instruments in the fastest-moving areas.

    The installations could be maintained for up to three years, during which
    some of the instruments were successively lost to ice deformation and harsh
    climatic conditions. This three-year record of englacial temperature in
    previously unexplored type of environment reveals new mechanisms by which
    tidewater glacier temperatures fluctuate.

\subsection{Tidal effects}
    \idea{Bowdoin surface topography is wavy showing that parts of the glacier
          are thinner. Could thin parts experience more longitudinal
          stretching than thick ones and be more prone to calving?}

    \note{Preliminary abstract. The two first paragraphs will be shortened and
          reworked to better reflect the introduction.}

    The observed rapid retreat of ocean-terminating glaciers in southern
    Greenland in the last two decades has now propagated to the northwest.
    Hence, tidewater glaciers in this area, some of which have remain stable
    for decades, have started retreating rapidly through iceberg calving in
    recent years, thus allowing a monitoring and investigation of ice dynamical
    changes starting the early stages of retreat.

    Bowdoin Glacier, a small and relatively accessible calving glacier in
    Northwest Greenland, appeared to be very stable since its frontal position
    had been first documented by explorers in the late 19th century. However,
    following a two-fold increase of surface velocity in the early 2000s, the
    calving front of Bowdoin Glacier has experienced a rapid retreat of ca.
    2\,km between 2007 and 2013. Since 2013, the ice front is once again
    stable, yet the glacier surface continues to experience lowering at an
    alarming rate of ca. 6\,m/a.

    Here, we present a two-year record of englacial temperatures measured in
    the tidewater glacier tongue. The measured temperature profiles indicate
    that the glacier's ice is below pressure melting point except for its
    temperate base. More surprisingly, a temperature difference of up to 2
    degrees was measured between two boreholes that are located only 250 meter
    apart along a flowline. In addition, the warmer profile shows a slow
    warming trend of up to ca.~0.5\,$^\circ$C\,a$^{-1}$\todo{Refine.}. This
    patterns can be explained by latent heat release from meltwater freezing in
    transverse crevasses that reach to or near the glacier bed. These crevasses
    may be related to the tide-modulated extensional strain regime of the
    tidewater glacier tongue.

\section{Introduction}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In many parts of the world, glaciers are currently slowing down as they
    become thinner. Yet this behaviour is not ubiquitous. Around the margins of
    the Greenland Ice Sheet, ocean-terminating outlet glaciers also thin, but
    accelerate and retreat faster than any other parts of the ice sheet.

    These so-called tidewater glaciers are partly submerged in sea water, such
    that when they thin due to surface melt, more and more of the glaciers'
    weight is balanced by buoyancy forces from the ocean. Basal friction is
    reduced and the glaciers flow faster, thus thinning even more. When the
    glaciers come close to floatation, basal friction may be so low that the
    only factor limiting flow velocities are the internal (longitudinal)
    viscous forces in the ice.

    However, ice viscosity depends critically on temperature. Between
    $-15\,^\circ$C and the pressure-melting point, ice softness varies by as
    much as an order of magnitude. Numerical models show that such differences
    in ice viscosity propagate to influence the flow and shape of entire
    glaciers and ice sheets.

    Previous measurements show that glacier ice temperatures can be below
    the pressure-melting point (cold ice), at the pressure-melting point
    (temperate ice), or both (polythermal glacier). Glacier temperatures are
    primarily controlled by air temperatures, geothermal heat flux, and
    internal heat advection and diffusion, but can also be affected by latent
    heating from meltwater refreezing in surface crevasses.

    Much of this knowledge comes from measurements conducted on mountain
    glaciers and the interior of ice sheets. However, ice temperature
    measurement from the terminal tongues of tidewater glaciers are presently
    lacking. In fact, tidewater glacier tongues flow at hundreds of metres to
    kilometres per year, and are characterised by strong longitudinal
    extension. Heavy crevassing on the glacier surface hinders accessibility
    and poses practical and technical challenges to instrumentation.

    Here, we present a new, three-year, continuous record of englacial
    temperature from Bowdoin Glacier, a relatively accessible tidewater outlet
    glacier of the northwestern Greenland ice sheet. Despite successive data
    losses to ice deformation and harsh climatic conditions, the record reveals
    new mechanisms controlling temperature variations in tidewater glacier.

\subsection{Drilling sites}

    Fig.~\ref{fig:boreholes}a -- Location map.

    Table.~\ref{tab:drilling} -- Borehole drilling sites.

    Bowdoin Glacier is a minor outlet glacier of the Greeland Ice Sheet located
    in its northwestern parth. The site was choosen for its accessibility, and
    because at the time of field campaign planning it appeared that the
    Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss was propagating northwest, although recent
    satellite gravimetry data show that now nearly all margins of the Greenland
    Ice Sheet loose mass.

    The glacier was first explored by western explorers in the late-nineteeth
    century. Photographs show that the glacier was thicker then, but its
    frontal position was only a few kilometers downstream from the present
    calving front. Since then it has been relatively stable. However, following
    a two-fold increase of surface velocity in the early 2000s, the calving
    front of Bowdoin Glacier has experienced a rapid retreat of ca.  2\,km
    between 2007 and 2013. Since 2013, the ice front is once again stable, yet
    the glacier surface continues to experience lowering at an alarming rate of
    ca. 6\,m/a.  Bowdoin Glacier velocities vary in response to tides and
    calves according to a relatively recurring pattern.

    In summer 2014, three boreholes BH1, BH2, and BH3 were drilled about 2\,km
    upstream from the calving front. After the sucessful drilling of BH1 and
    BH2 it was planned that another two boreholes would be drilled some X\,km
    ustream in the thicker part of the glacier. But due to weather the
    hotwater drilling equipment could not be shipped upstream and the third
    and last hole was drilled some x\,m downstream of the first drilling site
    and equipped with all instruments left.


\subsection{Instrumentation}

    Fig.~\ref{fig:boreholes}b -- Borehole sensors map.

    The boreholes were equipped with thermistor strings throughout the ice
    column, piezometers at the glacier bed, and inclinometers at different
    depths. The piezometers and inclinometers were also equipped with
    thermistors so that temperature could be measured at multiple depths
    through the ice column. This manuscript focuses on the temperature data.
    The pressure and tilt data will be presented elsewhere.

    At the first (upper) drilling site one borehole (BH1) was equipped with
    the digital inclinometers and the other (BH2) with thermistor strings
    and basal piezometer. At the second (lower) drilling site the unique
    borehole (BH3) was equipped with digital inclinometers, a basal
    piezometer and thermistor strings.

    Data loggers were anchored on the ice surfaced and powered with batteries
    and solar panels to collect data throuhout the dark and cold Arctic winter.
    In the case of digital inclinometers, the observed resistance from the
    thermistors were converted to temperature values in-situ by the englacial
    digitizers, thus avoiding to record the resistance of the borehole cables
    and their potential variations due to cable deformation.


\subsection{Temperature calibration}

    Table X -- Temperature calibration?

    All thermistors were calibrated prior to fieldwork in the lab (Martin?).
    For digital inclinometres to conversion from resistance measurements to
    temperature values is performed in-situ by the englacial digitizers. For
    basal piezometers this conversion is performed by the data logger installed
    on the ice surface. For the thermistor strings the conversion is performed
    during post-processing following the formula:

    \begin{equation}
      T = 1 / (a_1 + a_2 \log(R) + a_3 \log(R)^3) - 273.15
    \end{equation}

    where $R$ is the measured resistance, $T$ the ice temperature and $a_1$,
    $a_2$, and $a_3$ coefficients calibrated individually for each sensor.

    Despite this initial calibration it was observed that temperatures
    observed initially in the borehole right after drilling were not at the
    pressure melting point. Thus, where possible a recalibration was applied in
    post-processing by applying a temperature offset when the initial
    temperature data was available. Unfortunately some of the initial
    temperature data has been lost so that this recalibration was possible for
    some of the sensors only.

\section{Results}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Temperature time series}

    Fig.~\ref{fig:timeseries} -- Temperature time series.

    We obtain a temperature record for up to three years (for two sensors) and
    sussessive instrumental failures in between. After one year most sensors
    still worked, after two years some and after three years only two.

    After the drillings temperatures initially at the pressure-melting point
    drop following a s-curve as the boreholes refreeze and temperature evolves
    towards equilibrium with the surrounding ice. Within three months most
    sensors reach thermal equilibrium, but some some sensors refreeze after
    more than a year, where temperature is near but below the melting point.

    The sensors nearest to the ice surface exhibit a seasonal temperature
    cycle, which is out-of phase with the atmospheric temperature cycle, and
    whose amplitude increase with time due to surface melt.

    Sensors installed deeper down in the ice do not show a seasonal cycle but
    many of them exhibit a slow warming trend. The warming trend is most
    pronounced for the lower borehole BH3.


\subsection{Temperature profiles}

    Fig.~\ref{fig:profiles}a -- Temperature profiles.

    Temperature profiles depict temperatures below the pressure-melting point
    except for the base of the glacier. Coldest temperatures are reached in the
    middle part of the ice column, above which is found a layer of relatively
    high temperatures, and finally a seasonal layer.

    The upper boreholles BH1 and BH2, which are separated by only ten metres,
    show compatible temperature profiles. For BH3 the lower thermistor string
    show temperatures which are incompatible with those recorded by digital
    inclinometers in the same hole. Because the depths of digital inclinometers
    was calibrated from independant pressure sensors, we interpret that sensors
    on the thermistor string were misplaced due to a manipulation error and
    makr these data as erratic (ERR) (maybe this should go to the
    instrumentation section).

    The upper (BH1, BH2) and lower (BH3, ERR) boreholes show significant
    temperature profiles with differences up to ca. 2$^\circ$C.

\subsection{Englacial warming}

    Fig.~\ref{fig:profiles}b -- Warming profiles.

    Both profiles show a warming trend, except for the lowermost part which
    takes a very long time to refreeze after the borehole was drilled.
    However, the warming trend is much more prononced for the lower (BH3) than
    for the upper (BH1, BH2) boreholes. This warming trend is up to an order of
    magnitude higher than the theoretical warming by diffusion.


% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Discussion}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Deep crevassing}

    Fig.~\ref{fig:arcticdem} -- Topography around boreholes.

    Such local temperature variations have previously been observed in
    Greenlandic glaciers, but were restricted to the first xx metres below
    the glacier surface. Such differences have been explain by meltwater
    refreezing in crevasses. In summer surface meltwater penetrates in open
    crevasses. In winter it refreezes generating heat.

    However the temperature profiles at Bowdoin glacier show temperature
    differences over the entire depth of the glacier. Besides englacial warming
    an order of magnitude stronger than the theoretical warming due to heat
    diffusion occurs over much of the depth of the glacier. The different
    profiles and warming trend can be explained my refreezing of meltwater
    in deep crevasses reaching near or to the glacier bed.

    Although such variations could also be explained by the proximity of a
    moulin, no large moulins have been observed in the vicinity of the borehole
    sites or elsewhere on Bowdoin Glacier during the field campaigns. Small
    moulins have sometimes been observed, but such moulins would most likely
    refreeze over the winter and thus could not explained the observed
    continuous warming trend.

    Because it is a tidewater glacier, Bowdoin Glacier is subject to continuous
    extension yielding to the formation of transverse crevasses. The
    longitudinal extension is stronger at lowering tide and associated with
    seismic activity which is most likely indicating crevasse opening.

    The boreholes were drilled in a highly crevassed area. However, there is
    no clear surface expression of a higher crevassing in the vicinity of the
    lower drilling site.

\subsection{Link to ogives}

    The surface topography of Bowdoin Glacier exhibit bands, which are advected
    together with the flow of the glacier. They have a wavelength of around
    xxx\,m and an amplitude of xx\,m. These bands can also be visualized on
    satellite images. Topographic high appear as whiter and less crevassed
    areas than topographic lows. They originate from a steeper part of the
    glacier about xx\,km from the calving front and thus could be considered as
    some kind of ogives.

    The upper borehole site (BH1, BH2) is located on a topographic high and the
    lower borehole site (BH3) is located on a topographic low. This topography
    is not so obvious for an observer located on the surface of the glacier,
    because it is overprinted by the smaller-wavelength and similar-amplitude
    topography of penitents and crevasses. But the view from the upper drilling
    site was better than from the lower drilling site.

    We speculate that areas of lower topography may tend to localise crevassing
    as the glacier is thinner and thus weaker there, and meltwater has more
    chance to penetrate into the glacier there.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusions}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    We present the first continuous temperature record from the terminal part
    of a tidewater glacier.

    It can take more than a year for a borehole to entirely refreeze, so it is
    interesting to have continuous measurements.

    Temperature profiles separated by less than 200\,m and differing by up to
    2\,$^\circ$C indicating strong local temperature variations over the
    entire ice column.

    The warming trend of up to 0.6$^\circ$C in two years can not be explained
    by temperature diffusion and indicates deep refreezing.

    This is most likely the expression of deep crevassing. The localisation of
    such deep crevasses could be controlled by ogive banding.

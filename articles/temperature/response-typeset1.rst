Please ensure to provide us with the profile link(s) when submitting the proof corrections.

If obtaining the reproduction rights involves the payment of a fee, these charges are to be paid by the authors.**

    We have published the data. Could you please update the availability statement with e.g. "the Bowdoin boreholes temperature data is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3695960".

**Q11 Please provide the city name for “Groh and Horwath, 2016.”**

    Vienna, Austria

**Q12 Please provide the page range for the following references. “Khan et al., 2010; Phillips et al., 2010.”**

    Khan et al., 2010: L06501
    Phillips et al., 2010: L20503

    van der Veen, 2007: L01501

**Q15 Please confirm whether the formatting of “Tables 1–4” are fine.**

    Table 2 - There is a mistake (probably mine) in the middle line: a1, a2, a3 should be replaced by a0, a1, a3 as in the top line. Now that the two subtables are displayed on top of each other, the middle line can be removed.
    Table 4 - For readability, could lines starting with "(ERR)" and "(BH2)" be typeset in bold (as the line starting with "(BH1)")? Perhaps the middle line containing "Unit, Depth, Temperature (°C)" can be removed.

**Other**

    I see that several capital letters are missing in the reference list, for instance on "Greenland" (multiple references) or "Dr. Loewe" (Nye, 1955).

EVALUATION
==========

**Q1 Please summarize the main findings of the study.**

      *This paper reports ice temperature measurements from a
      marine-terminating glacier in NW Greenland. The authors find that ice
      temperatures within Bowdoin Glacier were warmer than that predicted from
      heat diffusion and viscous dissipation alone. They infer the missing heat
      may be from latent heat released by meltwater re-freezing within
      crevasses. The study builds on a very limited literature on this topic
      and is unique in revealing a full-depth temperature disparity. The
      authors also make some interesting assertions relating to the influence
      of ogives on ice temperatures.*

**Q2 Please highlight the limitations and strengths.**

      *The paper is well-written, well-structured and backed up by clear
      figures. Referencing is appropriate throughout. Statements, arguments,
      and uncertainties are well-framed and appropriately qualified.*

      *There are relatively few ice temperature profiles from Greenland and
      those from tidewater glaciers are even scarcer.*

      *The main limitation is that the opportunity to model the latent heat
      released by meltwater refreezing in crevasses was not taken (cf. Luthi et
      al., 2015, The Cryosphere). This would confirm the role of latent heat
      and help quantify the meltwater volumes involved. This could of course be
      a topic for future work.*

      *There is limited discussion of where the profiles reveal cooling (e.g.
      near the bed, see Figure 4b) and how this affects the interpretation of
      full-depth warming by latent heat released by meltwater re-freezing. This
      would be worthy of brief mention.*

**Q3 Please comment on the methods, results and data interpretation. If there
are any objective errors, or if the conclusions are not supported, you should
detail your concerns.**

      *The methods and results are robustly, comprehensively and appropriately
      presented and I have only one major comment relating to the methods:*

      *L171 - its unclear why the temperature data were re-calibrated to match
      the estimated pressure-dependent melting temperature. If the initial
      calibration was performed as indicated further calibration should not
      have been necessary. The melting temperature varies with pressure, water
      content and impurities so a difference between measured and theoretical
      values should be expected. It is also unclear why the empirical
      Clausius-Clapeyron constant estimated by Luthi et al. (2002) was used
      over other values for example for pure ice and air saturated water. Why
      was it necessary to re-calibrate to the melting temperature?*

**Q4 Please provide your detailed review report to the editor and authors
(including any comments on the Q4 Check List):**

      *Tables 1,2 and 3 (and certainly Table 2) could be moved to supporting
      information allowing a table of ice temperature results to be added to
      the manuscript.*

      *The manuscript is (often) written in the present tense when the past
      tense would be more appropriate. For example the first sentence of the
      abstract '... glaciers currently thin and accelerate' would be more
      correct if the past tense were used. There are many other examples that
      should be corrected.*

      - *L18 - insert 'of' before 'up to'*
      - *L21 - suggest change to '... reaching to, or near to, the bed ...'*
      - *L27 - past tense 'thinned'*
      - *L57 - suggest replace 'successive data losses due to harsh climate and
        ice deformation' with 'some data gaps'*
      - *L58 - insert 'a' before 'tidewater'*
      - *L62 - 60 km^2*
      - *L64 - it's unclear why a citation is required here or what it is for*
      - *L71 - when referring to Figures of cited studies I suggest you make it
        clear by writing for example: (Fig. x of Smith et al. 2000).*
      - *L74 - quote reads nicely but isn't necessary and should probably be
        removed.*
      - *L92 - insert 'the' before 'ice front'*
      - *L93 - suggest 'The emergence of subglacial meltwater forms several
        submarine plumes ...'*
      - *L120 - unclear why BH3 is unique, suggest just delete 'unique'*
      - *L127 - it is slightly unclear why this data is marked as erratic. Did
        the string get hung up in the borehole leading you to doubt whether the
        depths are correct. Please clarify.*
      - *L169 - replace 'constructor' with 'manufacturer'. Also, more details
        on the digital temperature sensor are required (e.g. model, accuracy,
        resolution, calibration procedure)*
      - *L198 - '... due to surface ...'*
      - *L223 - typo repeat 'of'*
      - *L278 - 'fastening' does not mean increasing speed. Suggest 'enhancing
        ice flow'.*
      - *L303 - delete 'an'*
      - *L308 - 'supraglacial lakes' not subglacial.*
      - *L317 - I think you mean 'low-solar angle', although of course light
        levels are often low at low solar angles*
      - *L340 and elsewhere - suggest more commonly used 'marine-terminating'
        instead of 'ocean-terminating'*
      - *L348 - suggest 'of latent heat released from meltwater refreezing in
        crevasses reaching to, or near to, the base of the glacier'*
      - *L354 - suggest 'fortuitous' instead of 'lucky'*
      - *Figure 2 - spelling mistake - 'piezometers'*
      - *Figure 2 caption - ensure consistency with abbreviation, or lack of,
        of month. Plus past tense 'were also equipped'*
      - *Figure 3 - this figure could be slightly improved to make it clearer
        and more informative to the reader. For example, It's unclear what is
        referred to in the caption as solid lines. It is also currently
        impossible to distinguish between thermistors by depth and labelling
        the lines by depth could be considered. Also, different markers could
        be used to allow different thermistors to be identified. The use of the
        same markers is particularly problematic where there are large gaps.
        Its not clear what all of the vertical dashed lines refer to.*
      - *Figure 4 - clarify for the reader whether date format is YYYY-MM-DD or
        YYYY-DD-MM. I would recommend adding dashes to make the date easier tor
        read.*
      - *Figure 4 caption - add 'see' before Fig 3. Past tense 'were' in last
        sentence'.*
      - *Table 3 - consider whether 6 d.p. is excessive precision for delta T*

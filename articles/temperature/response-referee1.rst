EVALUATION
==========

**Q1 Please summarize the main findings of the study.**

      *This paper reports ice temperature measurements from a
      marine-terminating glacier in NW Greenland. The authors find that ice
      temperatures within Bowdoin Glacier were warmer than that predicted from
      heat diffusion and viscous dissipation alone. They infer the missing heat
      may be from latent heat released by meltwater re-freezing within
      crevasses. The study builds on a very limited literature on this topic
      and is unique in revealing a full-depth temperature disparity. The
      authors also make some interesting assertions relating to the influence
      of ogives on ice temperatures.*

**Q2 Please highlight the limitations and strengths.**

      *The paper is well-written, well-structured and backed up by clear
      figures. Referencing is appropriate throughout. Statements, arguments,
      and uncertainties are well-framed and appropriately qualified.*

      *There are relatively few ice temperature profiles from Greenland and
      those from tidewater glaciers are even scarcer.*

      *The main limitation is that the opportunity to model the latent heat
      released by meltwater refreezing in crevasses was not taken (cf. Luthi et
      al., 2015, The Cryosphere). This would confirm the role of latent heat
      and help quantify the meltwater volumes involved. This could of course be
      a topic for future work.*

      *There is limited discussion of where the profiles reveal cooling (e.g.
      near the bed, see Figure 4b) and how this affects the interpretation of
      full-depth warming by latent heat released by meltwater re-freezing. This
      would be worthy of brief mention.*

   Thank you very much for your supportive and constructive rewiew! Your last
   point on cooling near the bed is of course a valid concern, for which we can
   think of several explanations.

   - Late refreezing occurs for some sensors even after several months (up to 15
     months for LT02). Even after refreezing, temperatures in the borehole
     continue to cool down slowly towards an equilibrium with the surrounding
     ice (following an S-curve). Regarding the profile plots it was not possible
     to choose a start date that would exclude the initial refreezing phase of
     basal sensors while leaving enough data to display warming trends of other
     sensors.

   - Vertical diffusion may be enhanced by basal melt affecting the distance
     between sensors.

   - Cable stretching, likely to occur near the base due to horizontal shear,
     yields to increased cable lenght and decreased diametre which both
     contribute to increased resistance. An increased resistance would yield a
     decreased apparent temperature (Eqn 1).

   The later explanation, which we think is the most probable, was briefly
   mentioned at the end of the results section. That statement was removed and
   replaced by a short paragraph in the discussion section on "theoretical
   warming".

**Q3 Please comment on the methods, results and data interpretation. If there
are any objective errors, or if the conclusions are not supported, you should
detail your concerns.**

      *The methods and results are robustly, comprehensively and appropriately
      presented and I have only one major comment relating to the methods:*

      *L171 - its unclear why the temperature data were re-calibrated to match
      the estimated pressure-dependent melting temperature. If the initial
      calibration was performed as indicated further calibration should not
      have been necessary. The melting temperature varies with pressure, water
      content and impurities so a difference between measured and theoretical
      values should be expected. It is also unclear why the empirical
      Clausius-Clapeyron constant estimated by Luthi et al. (2002) was used
      over other values for example for pure ice and air saturated water. Why
      was it necessary to re-calibrate to the melting temperature?*

   To be honest it is unclear to us too why temperature data needed to be
   re-calibrated. After the initial calibration the instrument were sent by
   container ship to Greenland. We do not know under which conditions the
   thermistors were transported and can not exclude that the calibration has
   been affected by the transport. On the other hand the in-situ calibration in
   the meltwater-filled borehole is to our knowledge the most reliable method
   to obtain obtain calibration parametres near the melting point.

   The Clausius-Clapeyron constant has only little effect on the recalibration
   as initial temperature offsets relative to the melting point have also been
   observed  near the surface were pressure is lower. It is indeed expected
   that the melting point in the borehole is different from theorerical values.
   We use the constant estimated by Luthi et al. (2002) because it was measured
   for similar conditions (water-filled borehole in Greenland).

   A short justification for the recalibration and the choice of
   Clausius-Clapeyron constant was added in the methods.

**Q4 Please provide your detailed review report to the editor and authors
(including any comments on the Q4 Check List):**

      *Tables 1,2 and 3 (and certainly Table 2) could be moved to supporting
      information allowing a table of ice temperature results to be added to
      the manuscript.*

      *The manuscript is (often) written in the present tense when the past
      tense would be more appropriate. For example the first sentence of the
      abstract '... glaciers currently thin and accelerate' would be more
      correct if the past tense were used. There are many other examples that
      should be corrected.*

      - *L18 - insert 'of' before 'up to'*
      - *L21 - suggest change to '... reaching to, or near to, the bed ...'*
      - *L27 - past tense 'thinned'*
      - *L57 - suggest replace 'successive data losses due to harsh climate and
        ice deformation' with 'some data gaps'*
      - *L58 - insert 'a' before 'tidewater'*
      - *L62 - 60 km^2*
      - *L64 - it's unclear why a citation is required here or what it is for*
      - *L71 - when referring to Figures of cited studies I suggest you make it
        clear by writing for example: (Fig. x of Smith et al. 2000).*
      - *L74 - quote reads nicely but isn't necessary and should probably be
        removed.*
      - *L92 - insert 'the' before 'ice front'*
      - *L93 - suggest 'The emergence of subglacial meltwater forms several
        submarine plumes ...'*
      - *L120 - unclear why BH3 is unique, suggest just delete 'unique'*
      - *L127 - it is slightly unclear why this data is marked as erratic. Did
        the string get hung up in the borehole leading you to doubt whether the
        depths are correct. Please clarify.*
      - *L169 - replace 'constructor' with 'manufacturer'. Also, more details
        on the digital temperature sensor are required (e.g. model, accuracy,
        resolution, calibration procedure)*
      - *L198 - '... due to surface ...'*
      - *L223 - typo repeat 'of'*
      - *L278 - 'fastening' does not mean increasing speed. Suggest 'enhancing
        ice flow'.*
      - *L303 - delete 'an'*
      - *L308 - 'supraglacial lakes' not subglacial.*
      - *L317 - I think you mean 'low-solar angle', although of course light
        levels are often low at low solar angles*
      - *L340 and elsewhere - suggest more commonly used 'marine-terminating'
        instead of 'ocean-terminating'*
      - *L348 - suggest 'of latent heat released from meltwater refreezing in
        crevasses reaching to, or near to, the base of the glacier'*
      - *L354 - suggest 'fortuitous' instead of 'lucky'*
      - *Figure 2 - spelling mistake - 'piezometers'*
      - *Figure 2 caption - ensure consistency with abbreviation, or lack of,
        of month. Plus past tense 'were also equipped'*
      - *Figure 3 - this figure could be slightly improved to make it clearer
        and more informative to the reader. For example, It's unclear what is
        referred to in the caption as solid lines. It is also currently
        impossible to distinguish between thermistors by depth and labelling
        the lines by depth could be considered. Also, different markers could
        be used to allow different thermistors to be identified. The use of the
        same markers is particularly problematic where there are large gaps.
        Its not clear what all of the vertical dashed lines refer to.*
      - *Figure 4 - clarify for the reader whether date format is YYYY-MM-DD or
        YYYY-DD-MM. I would recommend adding dashes to make the date easier tor
        read.*
      - *Figure 4 caption - add 'see' before Fig 3. Past tense 'were' in last
        sentence'.*
      - *Table 3 - consider whether 6 d.p. is excessive precision for delta T*

   Tables 1 and 2 were merged in order to save space. As we are well below the
   Frontiers limit of 15 Figures and Tables, we would prefer to leave this
   information within the manuscript (cf. author guidelines 1 and 2.3.4).
   However, a new table was added including selected temperature profiles.

   Parts of the manuscript were rewritten using the past tense.
   The line-specific comments were all implemented except for one:

   - L62 - We mean 60x60 km, i.e. 3600 km^2. The catchment of Bowdoin Glacier
     roughly corresponds to a square of this size.

   Figure 3 has been reworked to label each curve for the corresponding sensor
   unit and depth. The new figure is a little loaded but this is so far the
   only solution we could find to unambiguously label each curve. For BH2
   (where a continuous record is missing gaps), thin dashed lines were added to
   visualize the evolution of temperature between the 2015 and 2016 manual
   readings. Other suggestions on figures and tables have been implemented.

EVALUATION
==========

**Q1 Please summarize the main findings of the study.**

      *This work details a multiple-year deployment of borehole temperature and
      strain measurements in the fast-flowing regions of Bowdoin Glacier on the
      margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Measurements of this type are rare in
      Greenland the the community (including myself0 have had to heavily rely
      on limited measurement such as those by Iken et al. (1993) and others.
      Major findings from this study show significant longitudinal temperature
      variations over a three year period from 2014 to 2017. Englacial warming
      beyond diffusion and viscous dissipation indicate strong latent heat
      sources attributed to infiltration and refreezing of surface melt.
      Mechanisms for deep vertical entrainment of surface meltwater is
      facilitated by crevasses.*

**Q2 Please highlight the limitations and strengths.**

      *The paper is generally a strong paper. Only relatively minor weaknesses
      were highlighted and are detailed below.*

**Q3 Please comment on the methods, results and data interpretation. If there
are any objective errors, or if the conclusions are not supported, you should
detail your concerns.**

      *Details are noted below but no major incongruences.*

**Q4 Please provide your detailed review report to the editor and authors
(including any comments on the Q4 Check List):**

      *I am encouraged to see this kind of work which I think is critical to
      understanding ice dynamic response to wide-spread changed in the Arctic.
      I generally thought the paper was wet written and thorough. I can
      appreciate the difficulties in implementing this kind of work and the
      challenges faced in the field. The authors were honest about the nature
      of these challenges and provided a detailed record of such events as well
      as efforts to clean the acquired archive of spurious samples due to data
      drop-outs and malfunctions. This complicated the analysis but provided a
      robust accounting of observations. I applaud the authors fo this effort.

      In summary, I think this paper is a worthy contribution and would likely
      be highly relied upon in future investigations. I surely will be
      utilizing these results in my efforts to understand ice sheet response in
      fast-flowing outlet glaciers under warming conditions. I think the paper
      is acceptable to publish with minor revisions.

      Thoughts/Issues:

      -It might be illuminating to see how sensitive your estimates of strain
      heating to a range of plausible mean ice thickness or perhaps it might be
      valuable to understand how potential differences in density at depth
      (near surface vs. remelted ice at base) influence estimates.

      -For future could consider the use of FO-DTS (Fiber Optic-Distributed
      Temperature Systems) for both temp and strain (a system I had been
      interested myself in deploying but did not get funded to implement).

      -(Lines 307-314): for observed strain rates you could calculate
      theoretical crevasse depths using Nye model for both dry and water-filled
      crevasses and estimate what the maximum depth of crevasses would be. That
      at least provides some basis for considering the what the potential depth
      that could be achieved without speculating and could provide additional
      context on how you interpret temperature profiles.

      Background/citations

      -Line 29: Should include citations highlighting summary of GrIS wide
      velocity from several papers by Moon

      -Line 31: why use colloquialism “so-called” its not conjecture that we
      call these tidewater glaciers which is accepted glaciological
      terminology.

      -Line 31: not all thinning and acceleration for all GrIS outlet glaciers
      has been fully attributed to surface melting alone. This statement is not
      factually correct.

      -Line 48: Should include work by Colgan on cry-hydrologic warming.

      -Line 69: Is this statement true? What investigation has been done to
      establish that Bowdoin is the less crevasses than many other outlet
      glaciers across GrIS. I had not seen a comprehensive study to evaluate
      crevasse amount across GrIS. If you know of this study (which would be
      interesting) than cite here. If not than you might scale down the claim
      here in this sentence as it may not be accurate.

      -Line 72. Though quite interesting, I am not sure we need a history
      lesson here on how the glacier received its name and the historical
      explorations that established human evaluation of the glacier. I think it
      a bit superfluous even if its interesting. I would suggest removing and
      keep paper focused on the science.

      -Line 98: what is meant by “marine” part here? please clarify.

      -Line 192: How ere you able to determine when a thermistor reached the
      surface or near enough to potentially be solar loaded? Were these samples
      removed from the analysis as to separate them from your assessment of ice
      temperature variations?

      -Line 204-207: Consider revising this sentence it a run-on and difficult to follow.

      -Line 223” typo, remove one of the “of” here

      -Line 270 did the referenced Jania et al., 1996 paper conclude that
      observed ice temperatures above those recorded for air are due to release
      of latent heat or is this your summary of their results. If former than
      move citation to end of sentence so its clear who deserves the
      appropriate attribution for this statement.

      -Line 278: should say” and contributes to an increase in flow velocity”.

      -Line 303: “…at low tide…”

      -Line 351: I am not sure about the conclusion that differential
      mechanical damage between ogive highs and lows where boreholes exists is
      the likely culprit for explaining temp profiles vis-a-vis crevasse
      depths. I think the notion that ogive topographic lows create sufficient
      hydrologic potential to collect and pond surface melt for enhance
      vertical infiltration is most likely explanation. Having the theoretical
      Nye depths calculated at your borehole sites could easily bound if your
      explanations of mechanical damage are plausible.*

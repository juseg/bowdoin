Bowdoin Glacier rock sampling field notes
=========================================

2015 azimuths are in grades from 0 to 400 (magnetic North). 2016 azimuths are
in degrees from 0 to 360 (magnetic North). Both need to be corrected for an
important and quickly-changing magnetic declination. Tilt are in degrees from
0 (horizontal) to 90 (vertical). Coordinates are from my notebook and need to
be checked against recorded GPS points.

3 m granite table boulder located in the middle of the channel. The terrain is

*BOW15-06*

1.5 m boulder on the summit of a small hill, resting directly on bedrock. The
lithology consist of quartz and, I guess, amphibole and garnet and clearly
differs from the surrounding bedrock. The boulder contains large cracks and is
therefore easy to sample.

Cosmogenic sampling 2016
------------------------

*BOW16-JS-01*

Bedrock sample, granitic rock, very hard to sample. On top of secondary summit
next to the upper, automated ETH camera, about 5 m from the main cairn, which
was perhaps build by Riccardo last year. No nearby obstacle, shielding from
distant mountains only.

*BOW16-JS-02*

Bedrock sample, granitic rock. I used an existing crack for easier sampling but
it was still surprisingly hard. No nearby obstacle.

:Geog. coords: 77.69086, -68.50274, 295 m
:Sample depth: 4 cm
:Shielding: same as for BOW16-JS-01


*BOW16-JS-03*

Bedrock sample, pink granitic rock, very hard to sample despite an apparent
crack. Spent hours for just a small sample. Located about 20 m from both
BOW16-JS-01 and BOW16-JS-02, in the direction of the camp and of lower camera
hill. No nearby obstacle.

:Geog. coords: 77.69081, -68.50166, 294 m
:Sample depth: 5 cm
:Shielding: same as for BOW16-JS-01


*BOW16-JS-04*

Boulder sample, 80 cm diameter, white granitic rock, foliated, relatively easy
to sample thanks to vertical cracks near the summit of the boulder. Located
5 m from the large cairn, 8 m from bedrock sample BOW16-JS-01, resting directly
on the bedrock. No nearby obstacle.

:Geog. coords: 77.69116, -68.50163, 296 m
:Sample depth: 4 cm
:Shielding: same as for BOW16-JS-01


*BOW16-JS-05*

Boulder sample, 70 cm diameter, white granitic rock, foliated. Not so many
cracks as for the previous one, thus harder to sample, but small pieces slowly
came out. Resting on bedrock and on pebbles that rest on bedrock. The only
nearby obstacle is the hilltop with the cairn but that is negligible, as the
hilltop is almost aligned with the horizon from top of boulder view, and the
cairn probably much younger.

*BOW16-JS-06*

Boulder sample, 70 cm diameter, white granitic rock, foliated. No crack, very
hard to sample, and I am tired, therefore the sample is very small, but it
looks rich in Quartz. Resting on bedrock on three edges. The boulder is only
30 cm high, but about 80 cm wide. Located about 30 or 40 m from bedrock sample
BOW16-JS-03, in the direction of Mirror Glacier.

*BOW16-JS-07*

Boulder sample, 80 cm diameter, resting on bedrock. Granitic type, I think
similar to the ones that I sampled on the upper camera hill, foliated and
quartz-rich. Located on the crestline, about 20 m east of the third spillway.
No nearby obstacle, the nearest mountain is about 500 m to the East.

*BOW16-JS-08*

Boulder sample, 80 cm diameter, resting on bedrock. Same lithology as previous
sample but much harder to crush. Located 5 m South-East of the previous sample.

*BOW16-JS-09*

Boulder sample, 1 m diameter, resting on broken bedrock. Same lithology as
previous, easy to crush thanks to existing cracks. Located about 40 m
South-East of the previous sample. Shielding same as previous sample exept for
one nearby obstacle (N 215, 5 deg).

*BOW16-JS-10*

Boulder sample, 2 m diameter, resting on other boulders on top of bedrock.
Granitic type. I sampled the uppermost 4 cm that are very weathered. Located
about 40 m North of today's first sample BOW16-JS-07. The boulder is part of a
small ridge of boulders. I interpret this landform as the remain from the
moraine that has been preserved by water. Here, all the "fines" (everything
with diameter smaller than 20 cm) are gone, perhaps washed away. But this
landform is not located on the main crest but it is a little bit lower to the
North, towards the so-called East Arm Glacier.

*BOW16-JS-11*

Boulder sample, 1 m diameter. Granitic type, hard rock but easy sampling thanks
to cracks and the sharp top edge of the boulder. Resting on other boulders,
similarly as in the previous spot, except that bedrock is not visible: there
are too many boulders to see it. I assume this is the same landform as for the
previous sample. Located about 20 m North-East of the previous sample, towards
the waterfall.

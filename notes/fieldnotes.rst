Bowdoin Glacier rock sampling field notes
=========================================

2015 azimuths are in grades from 0 to 400 (magnetic North). 2016 azimuths are
in degrees from 0 to 360 (magnetic North). Both need to be corrected for an
important and quickly-changing magnetic declination. Tilt are in degrees from
0 (horizontal) to 90 (vertical). Coordinates are from my notebook and need to
be checked against recorded GPS points.

0.5 m block in balance over bedrock or half-buried boulder, very waethered.

*BOW15-04*

3 m granite table boulder located in the middle of the channel. The terrain is
marked by permafrost polygons but the boulder seems large enough to have
remained in the same position.

*BOW15-06*

1.5 m boulder on the summit of a small hill, resting directly on bedrock. The
lithology consist of quartz and, I guess, amphibole and garnet and clearly
differs from the surrounding bedrock. The boulder contains large cracks and is
therefore easy to sample.

*BOW15-07*

2 m angular block located about 5 m away from the cairn on top of the highest
hill by the calving front, resting directly on bedrock. The lithology is
similar to BOW15-06 but the garnets are much smaller.

1.5 m granite boulder located on the slope about 20 m below BOW15-07 in the
direction of the fjord. This block is more rounded and also harder to sample.

Cosmogenic sampling 2016
------------------------

*BOW16-JS-01*

Bedrock sample, granitic rock, very hard to sample. On top of secondary summit
next to the upper, automated ETH camera, about 5 m from the main cairn, which
was perhaps build by Riccardo last year. No nearby obstacle, shielding from
distant mountains only.

*BOW16-JS-02*

Bedrock sample, granitic rock. I used an existing crack for easier sampling but
it was still surprisingly hard. No nearby obstacle.

:UTM19 coords: 77.69086, -68.50274, 295 m
:Sample depth: 4 cm
:Shielding: same as for BOW16-JS-01


*BOW16-JS-03*

Bedrock sample, pink granitic rock, very hard to sample despite an apparent
crack. Spent hours for just a small sample. Located about 20 m from both
BOW16-JS-01 and BOW16-JS-02, in the direction of the camp and of lower camera
hill. No nearby obstacle.

:UTM19 coords: 77.69081, -68.50166, 294 m
:Sample depth: 5 cm
:Shielding: same as for BOW16-JS-01


*BOW16-JS-04*

Boulder sample, 80 cm diameter, white granitic rock, foliated, relatively easy
to sample thanks to vertical cracks near the summit of the boulder. Located
5 m from the large cairn, 8 m from bedrock sample BOW16-JS-01, resting directly
on the bedrock. No nearby obstacle.

:UTM19 coords: 77.69116, -68.50163, 296 m
:Sample depth: 4 cm
:Shielding: same as for BOW16-JS-01


*BOW16-JS-05*

Boulder sample, 70 cm diameter, white granitic rock, foliated. Not so many
cracks as for the previous one, thus harder to sample, but small pieces slowly
came out. Resting on bedrock and on pebbles that rest on bedrock. The only
nearby obstacle is the hilltop with the cairn but that is negligible, as the
hilltop is almost aligned with the horizon from top of boulder view, and the
cairn probably much younger.

*BOW16-JS-06*

Boulder sample, 70 cm diameter, white granitic rock, foliated. No crack, very
hard to sample, and I am tired, therefore the sample is very small, but it
looks rich in Quartz. Resting on bedrock on three edges. The boulder is only
30 cm high, but about 80 cm wide. Located about 30 or 40 m from bedrock sample
BOW16-JS-03, in the direction of Mirror Glacier.
